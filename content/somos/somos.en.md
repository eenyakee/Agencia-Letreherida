Patricia Escalona

After graduating in English Philology and realising that teaching was not my thing, I found my path in book publishing. Twenty years and several publishing houses - such as Ediciones B, Suma de Letras-Punto de lectura, The New Press in New York or Roca Editorial - later, it was time to turn the page, start a new chapter and face the blank page: I turned my career around to dedicate myself to copywriting with Ane by my side. And although it might seem otherwise, I swear that commonplaces have no place in my professional texts.
