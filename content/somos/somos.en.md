Patricia Escalona

With an experience in the publishing world of more than 20 years, I began to interact with words professionally in different publishing houses. After a period in New York working at The New Press, I came back to Barcelona and continued working with the written word, and I edit books, as a freelance, to this day. I also write copy in different languages, books, articles and everything you can imagine. I am sort of an all-you-can-write-buffet woman.

Journalist, editor, screenwriter, storyteller and broadcaster. I have been telling stories for more than ten years (professionally, that is; as a child, I drove everyone crazy in the process) and working for clients such as the United Nations and TED, doing radio, creating magazines, writing scripts, exhibitions and content of all kinds. There is nothing I like more than having breakfast reading Terry Pratchett.
